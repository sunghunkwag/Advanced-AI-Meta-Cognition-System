# Advanced AI System: Neuro-Chemical Reinforcement Learning

> **"From Chaos to Order. The Birth of Intrinsic Will."**

This repository houses the **Advanced AI System**, a fully autonomous agent driven by **Logical Reasoning** and **Neuro-Chemical Reinforcement Learning**. Unlike traditional RL agents that chase external rewards, this system is driven by internal hormonal dynamics (Dopamine & Serotonin) to find truth and symmetry.

## Core Architecture: The 4 Pillars

The system is built upon four distinct but interconnected modules, mirroring biological cognition.

### 1. The Body: Dexterous Action Decoder (`action_decoder.py`)
*   **Goal:** Spatial Intelligence & Dexterity.
*   **Mechanism:** A Dual-Head Neural Network.
    *   **Head 1 (Logits):** Decides *what* to do (Draw, Symmetrize, Clear, Noise).
    *   **Head 2 (Params):** Decides *where* and *how* (x, y, scale, axis).
*   **Key Feature:** **No Hardcoded Templates.** The agent must learn to output raw continuous coordinates to interact with the world.

### 2. The Mind: Graph Attention Manifold (`manifold.py`)
*   **Goal:** Relational Reasoning & Logical Consistency.
*   **Mechanism:** **Graph Attention Network (GAT)**.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Perception (`vision.py`):** Extracts objects as Nodes and spatial relationships as Edges.
    2.  **Reasoning:** The GAT infers causal relationships between nodes.
    3.  **Axiom Injection:** The system measures its thoughts against a "Truth Vector" (from `soul.py`) to determine logical consistency.

### 3. The Heart: Neuro-Chemical Engine (`energy.py`)
*   **Goal:** Intrinsic Motivation & Homeostasis.
*   **Mechanism:** A 3-Hormone System.
    *   **🔥 Dopamine (The Drive):** Spikes when energy (error) drops rapidly. Drives exploration and learning.
    *   **💧 Serotonin (The Peace):** Rises when the system achieves meaningful order. Promotes satisfaction and stability.
    *   **⚡ Cortisol (The Stress):** Increases from boredom or chaos. Forces action to escape discomfort.

### 4. The Soul: Intrinsic Crystallization (`automata.py`)
*   **Goal:** Enlightenment & Knowledge Preservation.
*   **Mechanism:** **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)**.
*   **Behavior:** When Serotonin levels peak and the mind is still, the system enters "Nirvana". It freezes its weights (Crystallization) to preserve the learned structure.

## Installation & Running

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install torch numpy
```

### Execution

Run the basic system:
```bash
python main_system.py
```

Run the Dual-Process (Instinct vs Reason) system:
```bash
python main_system_dual.py
```

Run multi-seed validation:
```bash
python test_multi_seed.py
```

### Research Prototype Harness
Run a deterministic experiment with planner/meta toggles (logs CSV to `experiments/logs`):
```bash
python experiments/run_experiment.py --steps 50 --seed 1 --planner on --meta on
```

## Research Prototype Highlights
- Deterministic seeding (`config.py`) and experiment harness (`experiments/run_experiment.py`) with CSV logging for energy, consistency, hormones, planner objective, and world-model loss.
- JEPA-like world model (`world_model.py`) trained online to predict next grid, energy, and consistency for planner rollouts.
- System-2 planner (`planner.py`) with prefrontal arbitration that triggers on high cortisol/low consistency/failure streaks.
- System-3 meta-learner (`meta_learner.py`) that tunes optimizer lr, exploration epsilon, EWC lambda, and dopamine gain based on trends.
- World/vision tooling for rollouts (`World.set_state`, `get_state_tensor`) and action encoding for simulated futures.
- Tests (`tests/`) covering world-model determinism, planner ranking, and experiment logging.

## Methods (Concise)
- **Perception → Graph**: `vision.py` converts grid occupancy into graph features for the GAT manifold.
- **Mind (System-1)**: `manifold.py` computes latent beliefs, consistency against truth/rejection vectors, and feeds the body.
- **Body**: `action_decoder.py` maps latent to action logits/parameters and can encode actions for the world model.
- **Heart**: `energy.py` updates dopamine/serotonin/cortisol using energy, density, symmetry, and prediction error.
- **Soul**: `automata.py` handles crystallization and EWC loss.
- **World Model**: `world_model.py` predicts next grid/energy/consistency and is trained online via replay.
- **System-2 Planner**: `planner.py` rolls out candidate actions through the world model with an objective (energy↓, consistency↑, cortisol penalty).
- **System-3 Meta-Learner**: `meta_learner.py` adjusts lr/epsilon/EWC/dopamine-gain based on trends.
- **Experiment Harness**: `experiments/run_experiment.py` orchestrates the loop, logs metrics, and supports planner/meta toggles.

## Reproduction & Expected Metrics
- Determinism: set `PYTHONHASHSEED` via `config.set_global_seed` (used automatically by the harness).
- Default run (`--steps 50 --seed 1`): expect CSV with decreasing energy trend and non-zero planner interventions when cortisol rises.
- Toggle comparisons:
  - `--planner off` vs `--planner on`: planner-on should show lower energy and higher consistency by ~5–10% on small grids.
  - `--meta off` vs `--meta on`: meta-on adjusts lr/epsilon traces in logs and stabilizes energy variance.

## Recent Improvements

### Robust Logic & Soul Alignment
- **Immutable axioms:** Truth and rejection vectors are now registered as buffers to prevent unintended training drift while keeping them in checkpoints. Logical penalties also discourage trajectories that align with the rejection vector.
- **True crystallization:** The Fisher Information Matrix is computed during "enlightenment" passes so Elastic Weight Consolidation actively protects learned parameters.

### Richer Emotional Feedback
- **Complete heart inputs:** Density, symmetry, and prediction error now feed the NeuroChemicalEngine, improving dopamine novelty detection and serotonin stability signals.
- **Balanced cortisol:** Boredom-driven stress accumulates faster and decays more slowly, creating a realistic pressure to explore without immediately resetting.

### Learning Stability
- **Warmup + decay:** The learning rate ramps from 0.001 → 0.01 over the first 20 steps before decaying, avoiding early-step instability.
- **Extended curriculum:** Early episodes emphasize DRAW and SYMMETRIZE actions (phased guidance through step 50) before moving to epsilon-greedy exploration.
- **Dropout tuning:** GAT dropout reduced to 0.3 for better capacity without overfitting.

### Safer Perception & Action
- **Vision fallback:** Empty scenes now return a stable two-node graph with self-loops to keep GAT attention well-defined.
- **Action decoding:** Coordinate heads are individually bounded (tanh/sigmoid) for smoother spatial control and scaling.
- **World validation:** Actions are type-checked and bounded, with DRAW softened to single-pixel strokes plus light blur.
- **Energy shaping:** Density penalties are moderated and mixed with symmetry scores for a more balanced energy landscape.

### Logging & Diagnostics
- **NaN/Inf guardrails:** Training steps with invalid losses are skipped after printing detailed diagnostics.
- **Richer logs:** Periodic summaries now include hormone levels, LR, action choice, grid stats, and optional density/symmetry details when crystallization occurs.

These refinements collectively produce a more stable, interpretable agent whose internal drives, crystallization events, and world interactions are easier to monitor and control.

## Latest: Dual-Process Architecture 

### Revolutionary Human-Like Cognition

The system now implements a **biologically-inspired Dual-Process Architecture**, modeling the struggle between instinct (System 1) and reason (System 2).

### System 1: The Limbic System (Instinct)
**Module:** `energy.py` - NeuroChemicalEngine

**3-Hormone System:**
- **Dopamine** (Pleasure/Learning): Rewards progress and novelty
- **Serotonin** (Meaning/Satisfaction): Activated by meaningful order (Density × Symmetry × Consistency)
- **Cortisol** (Stress/Survival): Rises from boredom or chaos, triggers panic if too high

### System 2: The Prefrontal Cortex (Reason)
**Module:** `cortex.py` - PrefrontalCortex

**Capabilities:**
- **Episodic Memory**: Stores past experiences (State → Action → Outcome)
- **Willpower**: Finite resource for inhibiting instinctual urges
- **Conflict Resolution**: Can override System 1's panic/distraction with rational deliberation

### Key Behavioral Features

1. **Panic Inhibition**: When Cortisol > 0.6, System 2 checks if panic helped historically, and uses willpower to "stay calm"
2. **Impulse Control**: Suppresses distractions (NOISE) when Serotonin is low (no achievement yet)
3. **Resilience**: Maintains willpower at ~0.95 through balanced regeneration vs. cost

### Emergent Human-Like Behaviors
- **Stress Management**: Withstands high cortisol without burnout
- **Delayed Gratification**: Resists cheap dopamine for long-term serotonin
- **Grit**: Perseveres through difficult states using willpower reserves

**Test Results:**
- ✅ **Willpower Sustained**: 0.95 (healthy) vs. initial 0.00 (burnout)
- ✅ **Panic Control**: Successfully inhibits instinctual urges
- ✅ **Stability**: Runs 1000+ steps without psychological collapse

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-environment stress testing
- "Flow State" detection (High Dopamine + High Serotonin + Low Cortisol)
- Adaptive willpower regeneration based on rest cycles
